* Class: Gfx2TreePartition

A 2D binary tree space partition.~
- inherit from: TreePartition~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx2TreePartition''(maxChildren: number, maxDepth: number, rect: Gfx2BoundingRect): Gfx2TreePartition~
-- ''maxChildren'': The maximum number of children that a node in the tree can have. It determines the branching factor of the tree, i.e.~
-- ''maxDepth'': The maximum depth or level of the tree partition. It determines how deep the tree can be divided into smaller partitions.~
-- ''rect'': The top bounding rectangle of the tree partition space.~
