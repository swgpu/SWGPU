* Class: AIPathGraphSolver

Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.~
** Constructors
- ''new AIPathGraphSolver''(): AIPathGraphSolver~
** Methods
- ''heuristic''(graph: AIPathGraph, nodeA: AIPathNode, nodeB: AIPathNode): number~
Calculates the distance between two nodes in a graph.~
-- ''graph'': The path graph.~
-- ''nodeA'': The node A.~
-- ''nodeB'': The node B.~
~
- ''solve''(graph: AIPathGraph, startNode: AIPathNode, endNode: AIPathNode)~
Find the shortest path between a start node and an end node in a given graph and returns the path.~
-- ''graph'': The path graph.~
-- ''startNode'': The starting node of the path.~
-- ''endNode'': The destination node.~
