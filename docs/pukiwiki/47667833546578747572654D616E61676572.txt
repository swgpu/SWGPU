* Class: Gfx3TextureManager

Singleton 3D textures manager.~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx3TextureManager''(): Gfx3TextureManager~
** Methods
- ''deleteTexture''(path: string): void~
Deletes a texture if it exists, otherwise it throws an error.~
-- ''path'': The file path.~
~
- ''getTexture''(path: string): Gfx3Texture~
Returns a texture or throws an error if doesn't exist.~
-- ''path'': The file path.~
~
- ''hasTexture''(path: string): boolean~
Checks if a texture exists.~
-- ''path'': The path file.~
~
- ''loadCubemapTexture''(path: string, extension: string): Promise~
Load asynchronously a list of cubemap images from a given path and returns it as an texture, caching it for future use.~
Note: Six images are required, each names postfixed by: right, left, top, bottom, front and back.~
-- ''path'': The file path excluding directions postfix.~
-- ''extension''~
~
- ''loadTexture''(path: string, samplerDescriptor: GPUSamplerDescriptor): Promise~
Loads asynchronously an image from a given path and returns it as a texture, caching it for future use.~
-- ''path'': The file path.~
-- ''samplerDescriptor'': The sampler texture configuration, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#GPUSamplerDescriptor.~
~
- ''loadTexture8bit''(path: string, samplerDescriptor: GPUSamplerDescriptor): Promise~
Load asynchronously an image from a given path and returns it as an 8bits texture, caching it for future use.~
-- ''path'': The file path.~
-- ''samplerDescriptor'': The sampler texture configuration, see https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#GPUSamplerDescriptor.~
~
- ''releaseTextures''(): void~
Deletes all stored textures.~
