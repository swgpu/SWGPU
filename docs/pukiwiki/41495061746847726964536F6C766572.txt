* Class: AIPathGridSolver

Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between a start coordinate and an end coordinate on a grid.~
** Constructors
- ''new AIPathGridSolver''(): AIPathGridSolver~
** Methods
- ''heuristic''(grid: AIPathGrid, a: T, b: T)~
Returns an array of more closest to least close directions to move from point A to point B on a given grid.~
-- ''grid'': The grid.~
-- ''a'': The starting position in the grid.~
-- ''b'': The destination position in the grid.~
~
- ''solve''(grid: AIPathGrid, startCoord: T, endCoord: T)~
Find the shortest path between a start node and an end node in a given grid and returns the path.~
-- ''grid'': A grid representing the pathfinding area. It contains information about the obstacles and the values of each cell (empty = 0, obstacle = 1).~
-- ''startCoord'': The starting position in the grid.~
-- ''endCoord'': The destination position in the grid.~
