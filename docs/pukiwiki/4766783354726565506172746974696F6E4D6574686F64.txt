* Class: Gfx3TreePartitionMethod

A 3D binary tree partition method for quick search intersections.~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx3TreePartitionMethod''(box: Gfx3BoundingBox, axis): Gfx3TreePartitionMethod~
-- ''box'': The position and size of the partition box.~
-- ''axis'': The split axis of the partition.~
** Methods
- ''search''(node: TreePartitionNode, target: Gfx3BoundingBox, results: Gfx3BoundingBox[])~
Search and return all objects that intersect with the target.~
-- ''node''~
-- ''target'': The target object.~
-- ''results'': All matching objects.~
~
- ''split''(objects: Gfx3BoundingBox[]): SplitResult~
Splits objects into left and right based on a specified axis, finally it returns new partition methods for each side.~
-- ''objects'': A list of bounding box.~
