* Class: Gfx2TreePartitionMethod

A 2D binary tree space partition method for quick search intersections.~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx2TreePartitionMethod''(rect: Gfx2BoundingRect, axis): Gfx2TreePartitionMethod~
-- ''rect'': The partition rectangle.~
-- ''axis'': The partition split axis.~
** Methods
- ''search''(node: TreePartitionNode, target: Gfx2BoundingRect, results: Gfx2BoundingRect[])~
Search and return all objects that intersect with the target.~
-- ''node''~
-- ''target'': The target object.~
-- ''results'': All matching objects.~
~
- ''split''(objects: Gfx2BoundingRect[]): SplitResult~
Splits objects into left and right based on a specified axis, finally it returns new partition methods for each side.~
-- ''objects'': A list of bounding rectangle.~
