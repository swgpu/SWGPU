* Class: TreePartition

The root partition binary tree.~
- parent of: Gfx2TreePartition, Gfx3TreePartition~
** Constructors
- ''new TreePartition''(maxChildren: number, maxDepth: number, method: ITreePartitionMethod): TreePartition~
-- ''maxChildren'': The maximum number of children that a node in the tree can have. It determines the branching factor of the tree, i.e.~
-- ''maxDepth'': The maximum depth or level of the tree partition. It determines how deep the tree can be divided into smaller partitions.~
-- ''method'': Defines a method that is responsible for partitioning the tree nodes.~
** Methods
- ''addChild''(object: T): void~
Adds an object.~
-- ''object'': The object.~
~
- ''getMaxChildren''(): number~
Returns the maximum number of children per nodes.~
~
- ''getMaxDepth''(): number~
Returns the maximum depth of the partition tree.~
